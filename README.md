This repository attempts to provide figures on the number of HMOs in each Cardiff ward versus the total number of dwellings.

## Beware

- Licencing requirements for HMOs are more strict in Cathays and Plasnewydd, and so many more properties are registered as HMOs in these wards

- Households resident in HMOs would be better metric than the proportion of properties
